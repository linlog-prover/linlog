# linlog

A linear logic suite for all your needs: a command line program and a Rust
library that parse, print and decide sequents of classical and
intuitionistic linear logic and their fragments, keep the proofs in a
checkable form and show them as derivation trees or proof nets.

[API documentation](https://linlog-prover.github.io/linlog/) (rustdoc of `main`,
rebuilt on every push).

## Usage

The command line program is `linlog` (`nix run github:linlog-prover/linlog -- …`,
`nix build`, or `cargo run -p linlog-cli -- …` in a checkout). `linlog --help`
and `linlog <command> --help` document every option.

`linlog prove` decides a sequent. The first line gives the verdict, the
fragment the sequent was detected to live in and the engine that searched;
a proof follows as a derivation tree of the one-sided sequent calculus:

```console
$ linlog prove "A, A -o B |- B"
provable (MLL, classical, net engine)
─────── ax   ─────── ax
⊢ ~A, A      ⊢ ~B, B
──────────────────── ⊗
  ⊢ ~A, A ⊗ ~B, B

$ linlog prove "A & B |- A + B"
provable (ALL, classical, additive engine)
    ─────── ax
    ⊢ ~A, A
  ─────────── ⊕₁
  ⊢ ~A, A ⊕ B
──────────────── ⊕₁
⊢ ~A ⊕ ~B, A ⊕ B

$ linlog prove "|- A par B, ~A, ~B"
unprovable (MLL, classical, net engine): the count equation fails: a provable one-sided sequent of MLL has exactly #⊗ − #⅋ − #1 + #⊥ + 2 formulas, here 0 − 1 − 0 + 0 + 2 = 1, and this one has 3
$ linlog prove "A |- B"
unprovable (MLL, classical, net engine): ~A occurs 1 more time than A in the one-sided sequent, so they cannot all meet in axioms
```

An unprovable verdict says why where the counts of the sequent tell: an
atom whose literals cannot all meet their duals in axioms (whichever
additive alternatives a proof takes), or the count equation of the
multiplicatives; otherwise it says that the search was exhaustive. The
JSON output carries the same as `refutation`.

Three engines serve classical logic: for MLL without units whose literals
occur at most twice each, the *net engine* searches for an axiom linking
that makes the sequent's formula trees a proof net; for two additive-only
formulas the *additive engine* recurses on pairs of subformulas; and for
everything else the *focus engine* runs a focused sequent search over
bitsets (on repeated literals its count-based pruning beats the linking
search by orders of magnitude). `--mix`, `--affine` and `--intuitionistic`
choose the logic, `--fragment` and `--engine focus|net|two-sided|additive`
override what detection picks, `--timeout`, `--copies N` and
`--forward-copies N` bound the search (below), `--quiet` prints the verdict line only
and `--stats` what the search cost, in the counters of the engine that
ran:

```console
$ linlog prove --mix --stats --deterministic "|- A par B, ~A, ~B"
provable (MLL, classical with Mix, net engine)
─────── ax   ─────── ax
⊢ A, ~A      ⊢ B, ~B
──────────────────── mix
   ⊢ A, B, ~A, ~B
   ─────────────── ⅋
   ⊢ A ⅋ B, ~A, ~B
literals chosen: 2
links tried: 2
exact tests run: 2
time: 63.45µs
$ linlog prove --engine focus --stats --quiet --deterministic "|- A * B, C * (~A par ~B), ~C"
provable (MLL, classical, focus engine)
stable sequents visited: 2 (0 from the memo)
memo entries at most: 2
splits examined: 3
time: 56.66µs
```

`--net` shows the proof as a proof net instead of a derivation: the
sequent, the axiom links as pairs of literals with their positions in the
sequent's subformula numbering, and the verdict of the correctness
criterion. With the net engine this is the net the search found; with the
focus engine it is read off the proof. Proof nets exist for MLL without
units, with or without Mix:

```console
$ linlog prove --net "|- A * B, C * (~A par ~B), ~C"
provable (MLL, classical, net engine)
⊢ A ⊗ B, C ⊗ (~A ⅋ ~B), ~C
A[1] — ~A[6]
B[2] — ~B[7]
C[4] — ~C[8]
proof net
$ linlog prove --engine net "A & B |- A"
error: proof nets exist for MLL without units only, not for ALL
```

With exponentials (MELL and full LL) the focus engine searches dyadic
sequents under a bound on how often a `?` formula is copied on one branch,
which it deepens from zero: by default it goes on to the next bound until
it decides or the time limit passes, two seconds unless `--timeout` says
otherwise (`--timeout none` lifts it), and `--copies N` caps the bound at
N. The derivation shows the standard rules: dereliction, contraction,
weakening and promotion.

```console
$ linlog prove "!A |- A * A"
provable (MELL, classical, focus engine)
─────── ax    ─────── ax
⊢ ~A, A       ⊢ ~A, A
──────── ?d   ──────── ?d
⊢ ?~A, A      ⊢ ?~A, A
────────────────────── ⊗
  ⊢ ?~A, ?~A, A ⊗ A
  ───────────────── ?c
    ⊢ ?~A, A ⊗ A
$ linlog prove "!A, !(A -o B), !(B -o C) |- C"
provable (MELL, classical, focus engine)
              ─────── ax   ─────── ax
              ⊢ ~B, B      ⊢ ~C, C
─────── ax    ──────────────────── ⊗
⊢ ~A, A         ⊢ ~B, B ⊗ ~C, C
──────── ?d    ────────────────── ?d
⊢ ?~A, A       ⊢ ~B, ?(B ⊗ ~C), C
───────────────────────────────── ⊗
   ⊢ ?~A, A ⊗ ~B, ?(B ⊗ ~C), C
  ────────────────────────────── ?d
  ⊢ ?~A, ?(A ⊗ ~B), ?(B ⊗ ~C), C
```

Provability in MELL has no known decision procedure, and full linear logic
is undecidable, so the verdict is three-valued: "unprovable" is reported
only when a bound was searched exhaustively without ever hitting it, and
"unknown" when the time limit, the bound of `--copies` or another limit
ended the search first. The line says which, after how long, at which copy
bound, and which flag changes it; `--stats` adds the copy bound reached:

<!-- readme-check: machine -->
```console
$ linlog prove -q "!(A & B) |- A * B"
provable (LL, classical, focus engine)
$ linlog prove -q --copies 1 "!(A & B) |- A * B"
unknown (LL, classical, focus engine): the copy bound of 1 was reached after 54.08µs; raise it with --copies N, or lift it with --copies none to deepen it while the time limit lasts
$ linlog prove -q "A |- !A"
unprovable (MELL, classical, focus engine): the search was exhaustive
$ linlog prove -q "!(A -o A * A), !(B * B -o C), A, B |- C"
unknown (MELL, classical, focus engine): the time limit of 2s was reached at a copy bound of 512; --timeout DURATION gives the search longer
```

The deepening is why a call without flags answers within its time limit
whatever it is given, and why an answer near the limit depends on the
machine: a script that must get the same answer everywhere names its
bound (`--copies`) or lifts the limit (`--timeout none`), and
`--deterministic` (below) makes the statistics a function of the input:

```console
$ linlog prove -q --deterministic --stats --bias rarer --copies 3 "!(A -o B), !(B -o C), !(C -o D), !(D -o E), A |- E"
unknown (MELL, classical, focus engine): the copy bound of 3 was reached after 36.65µs; raise it with --copies N, or lift it with --copies none to deepen it while the time limit lasts
stable sequents visited: 10 (0 from the memo)
memo entries at most: 4
splits examined: 24
copy bound reached: 3
time: 36.65µs
$ linlog prove -q --deterministic --stats --bias rarer --timeout none "!(A -o B), !(B -o C), !(C -o D), !(D -o E), A |- E"
provable (MELL, classical, focus engine)
stable sequents visited: 15 (0 from the memo)
memo entries at most: 5
splits examined: 28
copy bound reached: 4
time: 60.01µs
```

While a search runs longer than half a second, a line on standard error
says so when that is a terminal, and goes again when the answer comes.

`--affine` allows weakening: a hypothesis may go unused, which the
derivation shows as `wk` below the leaf that leaves it over. With
exponentials the affine search deepens its copy bound like the linear
one:

<!-- readme-check: machine -->
```console
$ linlog prove -a "A, B |- A"
provable (MLL, classical affine, focus engine)
  ─────── ax
  ⊢ ~A, A
─────────── wk
⊢ ~A, ~B, A
$ linlog prove -q -a "!(A -o A * A), A |- ?B"
unknown (MELL, classical affine, focus engine): the time limit of 2s was reached at a copy bound of 18; --timeout DURATION gives the search longer
```

The focused engines treat one literal of every atom as positive, which
decides where a proof keeps its focus and never what is provable; `--bias`
names the rule. `factors` makes the literal positive that is more often a
direct factor of a `⊗` (such a `⊗` needs no search for its split), `rarer`
the one with fewer occurrences. Without exponentials the default, `auto`,
is `factors`, and under `--affine` it is `rarer`. With exponentials
neither wins: on Horn clauses under `!`, a Petri net for one, `factors`
chains forward from the facts and is often faster by orders of magnitude,
but a forward chain takes one copy per step on a single branch, where
`rarer` chains backward from the goal within a few. So on a sequent with
exponentials `auto` runs both searches and answers with the first that
decides: alternating in slices of work on one core, so that the run stays
a function of the input, and side by side on several. By default both
deepen while the time limit lasts. Under `--copies N` the backward search
keeps to the bound; so does the forward one, except on a Horn program
(clauses such as `!(a * b -o c * d)`, a marking and a goal of atoms, which
is what a Petri net is), where it runs within `--forward-copies` (30 by
default), a bound in steps of the chain:

```console
$ linlog prove -q --deterministic --stats "!(a * a -o b), !(b * b -o c), !(c * c -o d), a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a |- d"
provable (MELL, classical, focus engine)
stable sequents visited: 47 (5 from the memo)
memo entries at most: 9
splits examined: 151
copy bound reached: 7
time: 136.45µs
$ linlog prove -q --deterministic --stats --bias rarer "!(a * a -o b), !(b * b -o c), !(c * c -o d), a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a |- d"
provable (MELL, classical, focus engine)
stable sequents visited: 14228 (13935 from the memo)
memo entries at most: 190

$ linlog prove -q --deterministic --stats --bias factors --copies 3 "!(a * a -o b), !(b * b -o c), !(c * c -o d), a, a, a, a, a, a, a, a |- d"
unknown (MELL, classical, focus engine): the copy bound of 3 was reached after 55.51µs; raise it with --copies N, or lift it with --copies none to deepen it while the time limit lasts
stable sequents visited: 11 (0 from the memo)
memo entries at most: 5
splits examined: 31
copy bound reached: 3
time: 55.51µs
$ linlog prove -q --copies 1 "!A, !(A -o B), !(B -o C) |- C"
provable (MELL, classical, focus engine)
$ linlog prove -q --copies 1 --forward-copies 1 "!A, !(A -o B), !(B -o C) |- C"
unknown (MELL, classical, focus engine): the copy bound of 1 was reached after 149.56µs; raise it with --copies N, or lift it with --copies none to deepen it while the time limit lasts
```

`--timeout` counts from the start of the command, so it covers reading
and parsing the sequent as well as the search, and the command answers
within a fraction of a second of it, on one thread and on several:

<!-- readme-check: machine -->
```console
$ linlog prove -q --copies 12 --forward-copies 12 --timeout 1s "!(A -o A * A), !(B * B -o C), A, B |- C"
unknown (MELL, classical, focus engine): the time limit of 1s was reached at a copy bound of 12; --timeout DURATION gives the search longer
```

<!-- readme-check: skip, the file is the LLTP library's -->
```console
$ linlog prove -q -i --timeout 1s --file SYJ212+1.020.p
unknown: the time limit of 1s was reached while the sequent was read
```

The second sequent is the largest problem of the LLTP library, a file of
86 MB that takes twelve seconds to parse; both commands
end with exit status 3 a second after they started.

By default the search runs on one thread first, and if that has not
decided within a tenth of a second (`--pool-after`), a pool of the
machine's other cores searches beside it, the first to decide answering: a
small sequent is decided at once and always the same way, a hard one gets
the machine, and what one thread decides within the limit stays decided.
`--jobs N` (`-j`) runs N threads from the start (with `--pool-after`, after
one thread), and `--deterministic` runs the sequential engines throughout,
whose proof and statistics are a function of the input, where a parallel
run may find a different proof of the same sequent, never a different
verdict. The
focus engine splits the choices nearest the root among the threads and
shares its memo; the net engine splits its search into cubes at its
first choices, and where every link is forced it makes each link once,
as one thread does; the additive engine is sequential in every case. A
search never uses more threads than the machine runs at once, and a
larger `--jobs` is taken as that many, with a note:

<!-- readme-check: machine -->
```console
$ linlog prove -q -j 4 --copies 3 "!(A -o A * A), !(B * B -o C), A, B |- A * A * A"
unknown (MELL, classical, focus engine): the copy bound of 3 was reached after 1.79ms; raise it with --copies N, or lift it with --copies none to deepen it while the time limit lasts
$ linlog prove -q --deterministic --copies 3 "!(A -o A * A), !(B * B -o C), A, B |- A * A * A"
unknown (MELL, classical, focus engine): the copy bound of 3 was reached after 2.55ms; raise it with --copies N, or lift it with --copies none to deepen it while the time limit lasts
$ linlog prove -q -j 10000 "A |- A"
note: --jobs 10000 is more than the 16 threads a search uses at most on this machine; it uses 16
provable (MLL, classical, net engine)
```

`--intuitionistic` (`-i`) reads the sequent as intuitionistic linear logic:
one formula on the right of `⊢` and pars only as implications, which the
one-sided form keeps as `~A ⅋ B`. The verdict line names the intuitionistic
fragment, and the derivation is two-sided with the rules of ILL. IMLL
without units goes to the net engine (the classical net of the one-sided
sequent is always an intuitionistic proof), a sequent of two additive-only
formulas to the *additive engine* (a recursion on pairs of subformulas,
linear in the product of their sizes, in every mode), and everything else
to the *two-sided engine*, the focused search keeping one goal on every
branch, with the same copy bound and affine mode as the classical one:

```console
$ linlog prove -i "A -o B -o C, A * B |- C"
provable (IMLL, intuitionistic, net engine)
           ───── ax   ───── ax
           B ⊢ B      C ⊢ C
───── ax   ──────────────── ⊸L

───────────────────────── ⊸L
  A ⊸ (B ⊸ C), A, B ⊢ C
  ────────────────────── ⊗L
  A ⊸ (B ⊸ C), A ⊗ B ⊢ C
$ linlog prove -i "!A, !(A -o B) |- !B & A"

 ───────────────── !R   ──────────────── !w
 !A, !(A ⊸ B) ⊢ !B      !A, !(A ⊸ B) ⊢ A
 ─────────────────────────────────────── &R
          !A, !(A ⊸ B) ⊢ !B & A
$ linlog prove -i -q --stats "(A & B) + (A & C) |- A & (B + C)"
provable (IALL, intuitionistic, additive engine)
pairs of subformulas visited: 20 (0 from the memo)
memo entries: 20
time: 89.90µs
$ linlog prove -i "|- A par B"
error: not an intuitionistic sequent: the subformula A ⅋ B is neither an intuitionistic formula nor the negation of one (⅋ only as A ⊸ B, that is ~A ⅋ B, and ? only under a negation)
```

Classical linear logic proves more than intuitionistic linear logic once
`0` is around, and the two-sided search knows the difference:

```console
$ linlog prove -q "((A * top) & (B * top)) -o 0 |- (A -o C) + (B -o C)"
provable (MALL, classical, focus engine)
$ linlog prove -i -q "((A * top) & (B * top)) -o 0 |- (A -o C) + (B -o C)"
unprovable (IMALL, intuitionistic, two-sided engine): the search was exhaustive
```

The exit status tells scripts the verdict: 0 provable, 1 unprovable, 3
unknown (the time limit, a bound, a limit or Ctrl-C stopped the search), 2 an
error, such as a sequent outside the asserted fragment or an engine forced
on a sequent it cannot search.

Every proof the search finds passes the proof checker before anything is
reported, whatever the output (`--no-check` reports it unchecked). A proof
is small where its derivation can be huge: the derivation writes the whole
sequent at every inference and repeats every subproof the proof shares.
So the command shows a derivation only where that is sensible, and
otherwise keeps the verdict, with its exit status, and says in one line
what it left out and how to get it. On a terminal the text format prints
the proof tree if no line is wider than the terminal and the tree is at
most three screens long (`--tree always` prints it regardless, `--tree
never` leaves it out; into a file or a pipe it is always written). On a
terminal 30 columns wide:

<!-- readme-check: terminal -->
```console
$ linlog prove "A, A -o B, B -o C, C -o D |- D"
provable (MLL, classical, net engine)
the proof tree is not shown: 7 inferences, at least 31 columns by 8 lines, for a terminal of 30 columns and at most 30 lines (3 screens); print it with --tree always, write it with --output FILE, or get the proof with --format json
```

And in every format a derivation whose estimated size passes
`--derivation-limit` (64 MiB by default; `none` lifts it) is not built at
all. The line then goes to standard error, unless the output is a
terminal:

```console
$ linlog prove --derivation-limit 100 "A, A -o B |- B" > verdict.txt
the derivation is not written: its 3 inferences with 29 characters of sequents are estimated at 616 B, over the limit of 100 B; --format json writes the proof itself, --derivation-limit SIZE raises the limit and --derivation-limit none lifts it
$ cat verdict.txt
provable (MLL, classical, net engine)
```

A run of one structural rule, such as the weakenings of every `?`
formula a proof does not use, can be drawn as one inference whose label
has a star: `--compact always` does so in every format but Rocq, and the
default, `--compact auto`, does so where the whole derivation would pass
`--derivation-limit` or not fit the terminal; `--compact never` draws
every rule.

```console
$ linlog prove -i --compact always '!A, !B, !C |- 1'
provable (IMELL, intuitionistic, two-sided engine)
     ─── 1R
     ⊢ 1
────────────── !w*
!A, !B, !C ⊢ 1
```

`--timeout` and Ctrl-C hold while a derivation is built and written as
they do during the search, and an `--output` file holds a whole output or
is left as it was.

A search also keeps within a bound on its memory, `--memory-limit` (one
gibibyte by default; a size such as `512MiB` or `4GiB`, or `none`). What
the search remembers is emptied first when it no longer fits, which costs
time and never an answer; when that is not enough, the verdict is
"unknown" with the limit as its reason, exit status 3:

```console
$ linlog prove --memory-limit 100 "|- (a & b) + (a & c), ~a par (~b & ~c)"
unknown (MALL, classical, focus engine): the memory limit of 100 B was reached after 32.28µs; raise it with --memory-limit SIZE
$ linlog prove --memory-limit 100 --format json "|- (a & b) + (a & c), ~a par (~b & ~c)"
{"verdict":"unknown","reason":{"memory_limit":100},"fragment":"MALL","mode":{"intuitionistic":false,"affine":false,"mix":false},"engine":"focus","statistics":{"nodes":0,"memo_hits":0,"memo_entries":0,"splits":0,"links":0,"tests":0,"copies":0}}
```

The bound counts what grows with the search (what it remembers, the
proofs it keeps, what each level of its recursion takes), not the sequent
itself. That has a limit of its own, `--occurrence-limit` (fifty million
subformula occurrences by default, or `none`), on every command that
reads a sequent: a sequent in JSON can share subformulas, so a file of
427 bytes that doubles one atom 25 times stands for 67 million
occurrences, and is refused before anything unfolds it:

```console
$ linlog seq fragment --file shared.json
error: the sequent unfolds to 67108863 subformula occurrences, more than the limit of 50000000; raise it with --occurrence-limit
```

No input ends the command other than by a verdict or an error: a formula
nested a hundred thousand deep is parsed, printed and searched without
recursion on it (the search itself gives up at `--recursion-limit`), and
a parse error far into a long line is shown with the part of the line
around it.

`--format json` writes the outcome as one JSON object, which is also a proof
file that `linlog check` verifies independently of the search (pass the same
logic flags):

```console
$ linlog prove --format json "A |- A"
{"verdict":"proved","fragment":"MLL","mode":{"intuitionistic":false,"affine":false,"mix":false},"engine":"net","statistics":{"nodes":1,"memo_hits":0,"memo_entries":0,"splits":0,"links":1,"tests":1,"copies":0},"sequent":{"terms":[{"D":0},{"V":0}],"ids":[0,1],"var_dict":["A"]},"proof":[{"ax":[0,1]}]}
$ linlog prove --format json "A |- A" | linlog check --quiet
valid proof of ⊢ ~A, A (classical)
```

`linlog interact` proves a sequent step by step, reading commands from
standard input: the open goals are listed with the position of every
formula, `rules` names the rules that act on a formula, `apply` applies one
(a `⊗` or Mix takes the positions of the formulas that go to its left
premise), `undo` retracts the last step, `close` lets the search close one
goal or all of them, `show` draws the derivation so far with the open
goals as bare sequents (`show --latex`, `show --typst` and `show --svg`
as proof trees), `save` and `load` keep a session as JSON, and `proof`
checks the finished proof independently and prints it or writes it for
`check` (`proof --rocq` certifies it, `proof --pdf FILE` draws it, and
`show proof.pdf` writes the derivation so far, open goals included;
every format of `prove` is a word with dashes there, and a file without
one takes the format its extension names). In intuitionistic mode the goals are two-sided and the
rules carry the names of ILL:

```console
$ linlog interact -i "A, A -o B |- B"
> goals
goal 0: 0: A, 1: A ⊸ B ⊢ 2: B
> rules 0 1
⊸L (with a split)
> apply 0 1 -oL 2
error: a premise would have 2 formulas on the right of ⊢ instead of one
> apply 0 1 -oL 0
opened goal 1: 0: A ⊢ 1: A
opened goal 2: 0: B ⊢ 1: B
> apply 1 0 ax
closed
> show
───── ax
A ⊢ A      B ⊢ B
──────────────── ⊸L
  A, A ⊸ B ⊢ B
> close
goal 2: proved (IMLL, intuitionistic, two-sided engine)
no goal is open: `proof` checks the proof
> proof
valid proof (intuitionistic)
───── ax   ───── ax
A ⊢ A      B ⊢ B
──────────────── ⊸L
  A, A ⊸ B ⊢ B
```

The exit status is 0 when the session ends with a finished proof that
checks, 1 otherwise. The same operations are the library's `Interactive`
type, whose JSON form is what a web client will hold between requests.

`linlog seq` prints a sequent one-sided in negation normal form, or
two-sided as intuitionistic linear logic reads it, converts it to JSON
(which a `.json` file or `--input-format json` reads back), or names its fragment:

```console
$ linlog seq print "A * B -o C |- ~C -o ~(A * B)"
⊢ (A ⊗ B) ⊗ ~C, C ⅋ (~A ⅋ ~B)
$ linlog seq print -i "A * B -o C |- ~C -o ~(A * B)"
(A ⊗ B) ⊸ C ⊢ (A ⊗ B) ⊸ C
$ linlog seq fragment -i "A & B |- 1"
IMALL
$ linlog seq json "A |- A"
{"terms":[{"D":0},{"V":0}],"ids":[0,1],"var_dict":["A"]}
$ linlog seq fragment "A & B |- 1"
MALL
```

`--format latex` and `--format typst` write the derivation of `prove` and
`check` as a proof tree to paste into a paper or slides: LaTeX for the
[ebproof](https://ctan.org/pkg/ebproof) package with the connectives of
[cmll](https://ctan.org/pkg/cmll) and amssymb (turnstiles aligned in
two-sided trees), Typst for the
[curryst](https://typst.app/universe/package/curryst) package. The verdict
line becomes a comment. `seq print` takes the same formats for a sequent:

```console
$ linlog prove -i --format latex "A, A -o B |- B"
% provable (IMLL, intuitionistic, net engine)
\begin{prooftree}
\infer0[$\mathrm{ax}$]{A &\vdash A}
\infer0[$\mathrm{ax}$]{B &\vdash B}

`--standalone` writes a document that compiles on its own instead, cropped
to the tree. Neither form chooses a font: the output takes the fonts of
the document it goes into. `pdflatex` needs the ebproof, cmll, amsfonts
and standalone packages, and `typst compile` fetches curryst 0.6.0 on
first use. Typst refuses a curryst tree with binary rules more than nine
inferences high, so a higher tree is written in a layout of linlog's own
instead: a `#context` block that lists the inferences and the Typst code
that measures and places them, which needs no package and sets a tree of
any height. `--style layout=linlog` asks for it at any height,
`layout=curryst` for curryst always, and `premise_gap`, `label_gap`,
`band` and `stroke` set its spacing:

```console
$ linlog prove --format typst --style layout=linlog "A & B |- A + B" | head -12
// provable (ALL, classical, additive engine)
#context {
  let open = "dots"
  let gap = (1.5em).to-absolute()
  let name-gap = (0.2em).to-absolute()
  let band = (0.8em).to-absolute()
  let stroke = 0.05em
  let dots = $dots.v$
  let nodes = (
    (1, $⊕_1$, $⊢ A^⊥ ⊕ B^⊥, A ⊕ B$),
    (1, $⊕_1$, $⊢ A^⊥, A ⊕ B$),
    (0, $"ax"$, $⊢ A^⊥, A$),
```

```console
$ linlog prove --format latex --standalone --output proof.tex "!A |- A * !A"
$ pdflatex proof.tex
```

Names of more than one letter are set in italics (`\mathit{foo}`,
`italic("foo")`), with the characters LaTeX or Typst treat specially
escaped; LaTeX writes Greek letters as their commands (`\alpha`) and the
`‿` and `·` of the names read from the LLTP library as `\smallsmile` and
`\cdotp`, so that pdfLaTeX compiles them. In `interact`, `show --latex` and `show --typst` draw the
derivation so far, an open goal as its sequent under vertical dots.

`--format svg` draws the derivation as an SVG image instead, and with
`--net` the proof net of the proof, for the sequents `--net` takes: the conclusions at the bottom, every `⊗` and `⅋` a circle (the
premise edges of a `⅋` dashed and blue, since a switching keeps one of
them), and every axiom link an arc over the literals it joins. The
verdict becomes an XML comment. `seq print --format svg` and `show --svg`
in `interact` draw a sequent and the derivation so far. The drawings ask for
the Euler Math font without embedding it; every text is stretched to the
width Euler Math gives it, so a viewer without the font keeps the layout.
The text stays selectable, and `--standalone` is refused, since an SVG is
always a document.

```console
$ linlog prove -i --format svg --output proof.svg "1, A & B, B -o C |- C"
$ linlog prove --net --output net.svg "A * B |- B * A"
$ linlog seq print --format svg "A |- A"
<svg xmlns="http://www.w3.org/2000/svg" role="img" width="70.272" height="27.2" viewBox="0 0 4392 1700" font-family="'Euler Math', 'Neo Euler', serif" font-size="1000" fill="black">

<text x="2712" y="1190" textLength="1380" lengthAdjust="spacing">, 𝐴</text>
</g>
</svg>
```

`--format png` and `--format pdf` render the same drawings as a PNG image
(at twice the drawing's size, with its title and description) or a PDF
page (its text selectable), in the Euler Math font the command carries;
with `--output` the extension names the format, which `--format`
overrides, and the verdict goes to standard error. Neither is written to
a terminal. A file is made only with a derivation or a net in it (or in
JSON, always): for an unprovable sequent the verdict goes to standard
error and no file is made, and an SVG on standard output is a drawing
or nothing. The PDF is an archival PDF/A-4 document (PDF 2.0);
`--style pdf.compatible=true` makes it PDF/A-2u (PDF 1.7) for tools and
archives that take nothing newer, and `--style pdf.accessible=true` an
accessible PDF/UA-1 document (PDF/A-2a), whose drawing a screen reader
reads as a numbered list of the proof's inferences. The document's date
is `SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH` when it is set, so a build can reproduce it byte
for byte, and the current time otherwise. Every drawing carries that
reading too, as the SVG's description.

```console
$ linlog prove -i --output proof.pdf "1, A & B, B -o C |- C"
provable (IMALL, intuitionistic, two-sided engine)
```

Everything an output shows can be changed. `--style KEY=VALUE` sets one
option of the format's options (`labels` upright, subscript or off, the
shape of an open goal, LaTeX's turnstile alignment, ebproof options and
preamble, Typst's import and page, the SVG's font, sizes and colours, a
PNG's scale, the text tree's bar and gap; `--help` lists them), with a
prefix such as `svg.` for another format; `--style-file` reads them all
as JSON, one object per format, which is the form a front end keeps;
`--lemma` and `--prelude` name the Rocq lemma and its file's first lines;
`--no-verdict` writes the derivation alone.

```console
$ linlog prove -i --format latex --style labels=subscript --style align=false "A, A -o B |- B"
% provable (IMLL, intuitionistic, net engine)
\begin{prooftree}
\infer0[$\mathrm{ax}$]{A \vdash A}

The first two draw these:

![The proof net of ⊢ A⊥ ⅋ B⊥, B ⊗ A](core/tests/snapshots/net.svg)

`--format rocq` writes the derivation as a proof script that the Rocq
kernel [NanoYalla](https://github.com/ComputerAidedLL/click-and-collect/tree/master/nanoyalla)
checks, the kernel of Click & coLLecT: a lemma stating the one-sided
sequent over the atoms as `formula` variables, proved by one derived rule
of the kernel per inference, with an exchange before a `⊗` where the
kernel's list sequents need one, and closed by `Qed`, so Rocq accepts the
file only if the kernel accepts the proof. The verdict becomes a comment,
and `--standalone` adds the import line. A proof with Mix or with the
weakening of affine mode has no certificate, since the kernel has no such
rule; an intuitionistic proof is certified as the classical proof it is.

```console
$ linlog prove --format rocq "A * B |- B * A"
(* provable (MLL, classical, net engine) *)
Lemma certificate (A B : formula) : ll [parr (dual A) (dual B); tens B A].
Proof.
apply (parr_r_ext []); cbn_sequent.
apply (ex_perm_r [2; 0; 1] [dual B; tens B A; dual A]).
apply (tens_r_ext [dual B]); cbn_sequent.
{
  ax_expansion.
}
{
  ax_expansion.
}
Qed.
```

To check a certificate, install NanoYalla 1.1.3 (the `nanoyalla`
directory of the Click & coLLecT repository) with Rocq 9 and its standard
library: `./configure && make && make install` there, or
`rocq compile -R . NanoYalla nanoll.v` and the same for `macroll.v`, then
compile the certificate with the kernel on the load path:

```console
$ linlog prove --format rocq --standalone --output proof.v "!A, !B |- !(A * A)"
$ rocq compile -R path/to/nanoyalla NanoYalla proof.v
```

Rocq prints nothing for a certificate it accepts. The kernel needs no
Yalla installation, and the certificate uses no cut and no axiom.

The syntax: `*`/`⊗` tensor, `|`/`par`/`⅋` par, `&` with, `+`/`⊕` plus,
`-o`/`⊸` linear implication, `~A` or `A^` negation, `!` and `?`, and the
units `1`, `bot`/`⊥`, `top`/`⊤`, `0`; `|-` or `⊢` separates the sides.

### Many sequents in one call

`prove` decides many sequents in one call, a batch, when it is given
`--file` more than once, a directory, a list of paths (`--files-from LIST`,
one per line, or separated by NUL with `--null` as `find -print0` writes
them, `-` for standard input), or an input format of many sequents:
`--input-format lines` (`NAME: SEQUENT` or `SEQUENT` per line, blank lines
and everything from `#` on skipped), `jsonl` (a sequent as `seq json`
writes it, or a record with a name, a mode and the sequent, per line) or
`problems` (the benchmark harness's problem files). Every sequent gets one
line, in the order of the input and as soon as it is decided, named by
its path as given, its line's name, or its file and line number:

```console
$ cat > sequents.txt
> # a comment, then four sequents
> identity: A |- A
> modus ponens: A, A -o B |- B
> A |- B
> broken: A |- (
$ linlog prove --input-format lines --file sequents.txt
identity: provable (MLL, classical, net engine)
modus ponens: provable (MLL, classical, net engine)
sequents.txt:4: unprovable (MLL, classical, net engine): ~A occurs 1 more time than A in the one-sided sequent, so they cannot all meet in axioms
broken: error: cannot parse the sequent
   A |- (
         ^ unexpected end of input
$ linlog prove --input-format lines --file sequents.txt --format svg --output drawings
identity: provable (MLL, classical, net engine)
modus ponens: provable (MLL, classical, net engine)
sequents.txt:4: unprovable (MLL, classical, net engine): ~A occurs 1 more time than A in the one-sided sequent, so they cannot all meet in axioms
broken: error: cannot parse the sequent
   A |- (
         ^ unexpected end of input
```

The exit status is the worst verdict: an error (2) before unknown (3)
before unprovable (1) before proved (0), so this one is 2. The second
command writes each proved sequent's derivation into the directory
`--output` names, in the format asked for, named after the sequent with
the format's extension (`drawings/identity.svg`; `ILL/01/X.p` becomes
`DIR/ILL/01/X.p.svg`, so the LLTP library's translations of one problem
do not overwrite each other). A file's kind
is its extension's unless `--input-format` says otherwise: `.p` is a
problem of the LLTP library, `.json` a sequent in JSON, anything else the
text syntax, for a single `prove` as well. An LLTP problem does not say
whether it is intuitionistic (the library keeps those under `ILL/`), so
the flags say it:

```console
$ cat > problem.p
> % Status (intuit.) : Theorem
> fof(rule, axiom, !(a -o b)).
> fof(fact, axiom, a).
> fof(goal, conjecture, b * 1).
$ linlog prove -i -q --file problem.p
provable (IMELL, intuitionistic, two-sided engine)
```

A directory is walked in sorted order, links followed, for the files of
the input format's extension (`.p` and `.json` by default); paths are
taken literally, relative to the current directory. On standard input
the batch is a stream: each line is answered as soon as it is decided,
so a program can ask, wait for the answer and ask again. With `--format
json` every answer is a JSON Lines record, the name first and then what
`--format json` writes for one sequent; the mode is the flags', a problem
file's column or a record's:

```console
$ echo '{"name": "pair", "mode": "intuitionistic", "sequent": "A, B |- A * B"}' | linlog prove --input-format jsonl --format json
{"name":"pair","verdict":"proved","fragment":"IMLL","mode":{"intuitionistic":true,"affine":false,"mix":false},"engine":"net","statistics":{"nodes":2,"memo_hits":0,"memo_entries":0,"splits":0,"links":2,"tests":2,"copies":0},"sequent":{"terms":[{"D":0},{"D":1},{"V":0},{"V":1},{"⊗":[2,3]}],"ids":[0,1,4],"var_dict":["A","B"]},"proof":[{"ax":[0,3]},{"ax":[1,4]},{"⊗":[2,0,1]}]}
```

By default the cores go across the sequents, one sequent per worker on
the sequential engines (as with `--deterministic`), and within one
sequent, as for a single call, when the batch has fewer sequents than
workers or is a stream from standard input; `--cores across|within`
chooses, and `--workers N` caps the sequents decided at once.
`--timeout` is each sequent's limit, reading included, and
`--batch-timeout` the whole batch's. Each search holds at most
`--memory-limit`, and as many run at once as `--batch-memory` holds (by
default half the memory the process may use, the machine's or its
control group's), so that a batch never holds more
than that for its searches; `--isolate` decides each sequent in a child
process of its own, so that one that exhausts the memory or the stack
ends only itself.

### Benchmarks

`linlog-bench` (`cargo run --release -p linlog-bench -- …` in a checkout,
or `nix build .#linlog-bench`) times the engines on three kinds of
problems: generated families with known verdicts (`linlog-bench families`
lists them: 3-Partition as a Horn program and as an MLL sequent,
Matsuoka's Partition, random QBF, wide sequents, contexts under Mix,
Petri-net counters and more, each at any size), the problems of the
[LLTP library](https://github.com/meta-logic/lltp) (`nix build .#lltp -o
bench/lltp` fetches it at a pinned commit; its problems under `ILL/` run
intuitionistically), and problem files of lines `name; mode; expected;
copies; sequent` such as `bench/problems/slow-tests.txt`. `run` runs every
problem in every mode, engine and thread count asked for, each run in a
child process of its own with a time limit, and writes one CSV row per
run with the verdict, the time and the engine's counters; `summary`
prints Markdown tables of CSV files: the problems solved within the time
limit per family and configuration, and a time per problem and
configuration.

```console
$ linlog-bench run --family partition-no=3,4 --engines focus,net --jobs 1,4 --timeout 10 --output runs.csv

```

`summary --before DIR` compares every file with the file of the same
name in `DIR`, an earlier baseline, problem by problem instead: the
verdicts that differ, the problems decided before and not after, one row
per family or LLTP collection and configuration (problems decided before
and after, late verdicts kept apart, where the undecided ended, the
median ratio of the times), and every generated problem side by side.
`summary --against FILE` compares every other file with `FILE` in the
same way whatever the files' names, as the passes under one bias with the
default:

```console
$ linlog-bench summary --before bench/results/2026-09-30 bench/results/2026-10-02/long-1.csv
…
| file | family | configuration | problem | before | after | after/before |

| long-1 | counter | classical auto j1 | counter/16 | > 1200 s | 280 µs ✓ |  |
| long-1 | counter | classical auto j1 | counter/64 |  | 85.14 s ✓ |  |
| long-1 | partition-no | classical auto j1 | partition-no/15 |  | > 1200 s |  |

| long-1 | partition-yes | classical auto j1 | partition-yes/28 |  | > 1200 s |  |
| long-1 | partition-yes | classical auto j1 | partition-yes/7 | > 1200 s | 230 µs ✓ |  |
```

`run --bias rarer|factors` runs the focused engines under that bias and
`run --forward-copies N` the default's forward search within that bound,
and the rows say which. `run --copies none` deepens the copy bound until
the time limit, and `run --pool-after SECONDS` searches on one thread for
that long before a pool of the other `--jobs` threads joins it, as the command does by
default; the rows have the copy bound reached (`copies_reached`). `bench/targets.sh LABEL` runs the target set of the
focused engine's performance work, the instances the first baseline
showed it losing on (the hard families at the sizes that took minutes or
did not finish, and a fixed sample of 113 LLTP problems), on two pinned
cores in a memory-capped user unit, into `bench/targets/LABEL.csv`;
`bench/TARGETS.md` sets the engine before that work beside the engine
after it. On one thread the engine's counters are a function of the
input, so two such files tell whether a change altered the search at all.

`bench/baseline.sh --arm --fresh` takes the whole baseline, every
family, engine and thread count and the whole LLTP library, unattended
in the night: a user timer starts it as a systemd user unit at 20:00 (or
at once if that has passed), where it waits for an otherwise idle
machine, runs about eleven and a half hours, and is stopped at 07:00
whatever its state (`--slot=HH:MM-HH:MM` for other times; the script run
again without `--fresh` finishes a stopped baseline on another night).
Every baseline keeps a directory of its own named by the day it started,
`bench/results/DAY/`: the CSV files of its runs, `starts.txt` with the
commit measured, and its tables in `RESULTS.md`, which `bench/RESULTS.md`
copies for the latest baseline; `journalctl --user -fu linlog-baseline`
follows it. A last stage runs again, with more time before the kill and
more memory, the runs that `bench/reruns.txt` lists: those of an earlier
baseline that were killed or crashed and that measurement showed to
finish with more room. The first baseline, of the night of 2026-09-30, took 9 h 21 min
on a 16-core Intel Core Ultra X9 388H, and a supplement on the next
night added that last stage to it in 1 h 28 min. The second, of the
night of 2026-10-02, after the performance work on the focused engine,
took 8 h 4 min with every stage and with the intuitionistic library run
again under each atom bias alone; `bench/RESULTS.md` has its tables and
`bench/COMPARISON.md` compares the two: no verdict differs, nothing
decided before is undecided after, and the intuitionistic LLTP pass
decides 2 047 problems within 5 s where it decided 737.

## What exists and what is planned

Built:

- Parsing and printing of sequents in the syntax above, with the ASCII and
  Unicode spellings of every connective, and a compact JSON form.
- Detection of the fragment a sequent lives in (MLL, MLL with units, ALL,
  MALL, MELL, LL, and their intuitionistic counterparts IMLL to ILL) and
  the modes classical, affine, intuitionistic and Mix as user choices.
- Intuitionistic linear logic on the same one-sided representation: a
  sequent is read two-sided by the polarization of its subformulas (one
  goal, hypotheses, `⊸` recovered from `~A ⅋ B`), printed as `Γ ⊢ A`, and
  proved by the two-sided focused search, by the embedding of IMLL into
  MLL proof nets, or by the additive fast path.
- Proofs as compact terms over subformula occurrences, an independent
  checker that decides whether a term proves its sequent (in
  intuitionistic mode also that every sequent of the proof has one goal)
  in one pass and in memory proportional to the proof,
  and a derivation view that unfolds a term into the tree of the standard
  sequent calculus, one-sided or two-sided with the rules of ILL, printed
  as text. The size of a derivation is computed from the term without
  building it, and every path that builds one (the text tree, the
  exports, the search inside an interactive proof) keeps within a bound
  on that size, which is an option.
- Automatic proof search for every fragment, MLL to full LL and IMLL to
  ILL, with or without Mix, returning a checked proof (the checker runs
  on every proof, in every build), "unprovable" after
  an exhaustive search, or "unknown" with the reason: a focused sequent
  engine over dyadic sequents of occurrence bitsets with a memo, counts
  that prune sequents and direct the search for the split of a `⊗`
  (contexts of any width), one representative for formulas that occur
  several times, an atom bias chosen from the sequent or by `--bias`
  (with exponentials a forward and a backward search together), a
  per-branch bound on the copies of `?` formulas that deepens
  iteratively, without end or up to a bound, and a loop check, one-sided
  or two-sided; for
  MLL without units a proof-net engine that searches the axiom linkings
  with count checks, constant-time cycle rejections, the exact acyclicity
  test and a symmetry break for repeated literal conclusions, then
  sequentializes the net it finds; and for two additive-only formulas a
  recursion on subformula pairs.
- Affine mode, where weakening is allowed, in every fragment.
- Proof nets for MLL, with or without Mix, as a representation of their
  own: proof structures over the subformula occurrences, an independent
  correctness criterion (Danos–Regnier, decided by Yeo's deletion test on
  the coloured structure graph, with a switching cycle or the
  disconnection named when it fails), sequentialization into a checked
  proof and desequentialization of a proof into its net, a text form and
  a JSON form.
- Interactive proving: a proof in progress as a derivation with open
  goals, rules applied to a formula of a goal and validated (the
  connective, the mode, the context a promotion or an axiom needs, one
  goal per premise in intuitionistic mode), undo, the search closing any
  goal, translation of the finished derivation into a term the checker
  validates, and a JSON form of the session.
- Export of sequents and derivations, finished or in progress, to LaTeX
  (ebproof proof trees) and Typst (curryst proof trees, and trees of any
  height in a layout of linlog's own), as fragments or standalone
  documents that choose no font, and drawings of sequents,
  derivations and proof nets as SVG, laid out with the character widths
  of the Euler Math font (or another font's), a switching cycle or the
  parts of a disconnected structure highlighted, with a reading for
  screen readers, and
  rendered as PNG and as archival (PDF/A-4, PDF/A-2u) or accessible
  (PDF/UA-1) PDF.
- Output configured through the library: one options value per format,
  with serde, for rule labels (one table per convention, or the user's),
  the shape of an open goal, alignment, preambles, the SVG's font, sizes
  and colours, and the certificate's names; the command sets them with
  `--style` and `--style-file`, and writes a derivation as it is made.
- Proof certificates: a finished proof as a Rocq script for the NanoYalla
  kernel, a lemma proved rule by rule and closed by `Qed`, for every
  classical fragment and for intuitionistic proofs as the classical
  proofs they are, with a flake check that runs Rocq on them.
- Parallel search, behind the library's `parallel` feature and on by
  default in the command: the focus engine runs the choices nearest the
  root on a thread pool, cube-and-conquer style, with the `&` premises in
  parallel and one memo shared by every thread; the net engine splits its
  search into cubes at its first choices for the pool; a stop condition
  reaches every thread; a pool has at most as many threads as the machine
  runs at once; the sequential engines stay one flag away.
- Time limits that hold: a stop condition is asked wherever a search can
  spend time (stable sequents, split searches, chains of forced splits,
  the set-up on a large sequent, every thread of a pool), and the
  command's `--timeout` counts from its start, reading and parsing
  included, and is kept to within a fraction of a second.
- Limits on memory and on the input: a search holds at most
  `--memory-limit` bytes (its memo is emptied first, then the answer is
  "unknown" with the reason), a sequent unfolds to at most
  `--occurrence-limit` occurrences, and no walk over a formula, a net
  or a derivation recurses on the input's depth.
- Defaults a newcomer can use, each of them an option: the copy bound
  deepens while a time limit of two seconds lasts, one thread searches
  for a tenth of a second before the other cores join it, an "unknown"
  says which bound or limit ended the search, after how long and at which
  copy bound, with the flag that changes it, and an "unprovable" says why
  where the counts of the sequent tell (an atom whose literals cannot
  pair up, the count equation that fails).
- The `linlog` command: `prove`, `check`, `interact` and `seq`, with time
  limits, Ctrl-C, statistics, JSON output, proof nets, LaTeX, Typst,
  SVG and Rocq output, and `--jobs`, `--pool-after` and `--deterministic`
  for the search;
  a proof tree is printed on a terminal where it fits, a run of one
  structural rule is drawn as one inference where the whole tree would
  not fit or pass `--derivation-limit`, and a derivation past the limit
  either way is left out with a line that says so.
- Many sequents in one call: files, directories, lists of paths and
  streams on standard input, in the text syntax, as JSON Lines, in the
  harness's problem files and in the LLTP library's format, one answer
  per sequent in input order, with a time limit per sequent and for the
  batch, a memory bound for the batch, and a child process per sequent
  on request.
- Benchmarks: a reader for the problems of the LLTP library, generated
  families with known verdicts (the hard families of the literature and
  the cases where one engine is known to be slow), and `linlog-bench`,
  which runs them with a time limit per run, writes CSV and summarises it,
  with a script that takes a whole baseline on an idle machine and one
  that runs the focused engine's target set by day, and a comparison of
  two baselines problem by problem.
- Performance work on the focused engine, measured by two baselines, one
  before it and one after.

Planned, in roughly this order:

- Ordinary classical, intuitionistic and minimal propositional logic
  through their translations into linear logic.
- A web front end for proving step by step in the browser.
- A Rocq library of linlog's own with certificates for every mode, next
  to the NanoYalla export.
- An engine for Horn programs (Petri nets), with coverability as a
  decision procedure in affine mode.
- A first release.
- Later: proof nets with exponential boxes, cut elimination on proofs
  and on nets, further engines for MLL and intuitionistic MLL (pruned
  net search, essential nets), the Lambek calculus, the inverse method,
  and first-order linear logic.

linlog is very much inspired by [Click & coLLecT](https://www.click-and-collect.linear-logic.org).
It aims to support more use cases on a modern, more efficient base.

## Architecture

Three crates, with a fourth to come: the library `linlog` in `core/` holds
all the logic; the command line program `linlog` (package `linlog-cli`) in
`cli/` is a thin front end; the benchmark harness `linlog-bench` in
`bench/` runs the library's engines on problem sets; a web front end will
compile the library to
WebAssembly, so the library uses no clock, and threads only behind its
`parallel` feature, which the web front end leaves off.

The library keeps a sequent as a compact arena of subformulas in negation
normal form, one-sided (`Γ ⊢ Δ` becomes `⊢ Γ^⊥, Δ`); an intuitionistic
sequent is the same arena read two-sided, through the polarization of its
subformulas, with no second representation. On top of that it detects the
fragment a sequent lives in and builds the occurrence forest, the
numbering of subformula occurrences that every proof-search engine, proof
checker and proof net works on. A proof is a compact term over those
occurrences, one node per rule instance; an independent checker decides
whether it proves its sequent, and a derivation view unfolds it into the
tree of explicit sequents of the standard sequent calculus, one-sided or
two-sided. A proof net is the same forest with axiom links, checked by its
own criterion and convertible to and from a proof term. Proof search
decides a sequent, or any goal within one, with the engine its fragment
and mode call for, sequent search, net search or the additive recursion,
and returns a checked proof, that there is none, or why it could not tell.
Interactive proving holds a derivation with open goals over the same
forest, with the same inferences as the derivation view, and turns it back
into a term for the checker once it is finished. The exports write
sequents and derivations, finished or not, as LaTeX and Typst source, one
inference at a time, draw them and proof nets as SVG from layouts of
their own: a tree by subtree widths, a net by its formula trees under the
axiom links, and write a finished derivation as a Rocq proof script for
the NanoYalla kernel, tracking the order of each goal's formulas so that
one exchange per `⊗` suffices.
