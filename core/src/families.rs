//! Problem families with known verdicts, generated at any size: the hard
//! families of the literature (3-Partition as a Horn program and as
//! Lincoln and Winkler's two-literal sequent, Matsuoka's Partition, random
//! QBF under a lock-and-key encoding into MALL, Petri-net counters), the
//! families where one engine is known to be slow (wide contexts under
//! Mix, wide sequents of distinct or shared atoms), and the slow cases of
//! the exponentials. Each instance says whether it is provable, by
//! construction or by solving the combinatorial problem it encodes, never
//! by running an engine. Random families are seeded by their size and
//! index, so an instance is the same on every run.
//!
//! # Examples
//!
//! ```
//! use linlog::families;
//! use linlog::search::{Options, Verdict, prove};
//!
//! let family = families::find("partition-no").unwrap();
//! let instance = family.instance(3, 0);
//! assert!(!instance.provable);
//! let outcome = prove(&instance.sequent, instance.mode, &Options::default())?;
//! assert!(matches!(outcome.verdict, Verdict::Unprovable(_)));
//! # Ok::<(), linlog::Error>(())
//! ```
//!
//! Needs the cargo feature `parse` (on by default).
