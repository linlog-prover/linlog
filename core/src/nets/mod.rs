//! Proof nets for unit-free MLL, with or without Mix: proof structures over
//! the occurrence forest, the correctness criterion, and the conversions
//! to and from proof terms.
//!
//! A [`ProofStructure`] is the sequent's formula trees, which the forest
//! already holds, plus axiom links between dual literal occurrences. It is
//! complete when every literal is linked. A complete structure is a proof
//! net when it passes the Danos–Regnier criterion, which
//! [`is_correct`](ProofStructure::is_correct) decides independently of any
//! search and of the proof checker: no switching cycle, and without Mix
//! exactly one connected component under every switching. A proof net
//! sequentializes into a proof term that the checker accepts, and a proof
//! term of MLL desequentializes into the net of its axiom links; two
//! derivations that differ only by the order of their rules give the same
//! net.
