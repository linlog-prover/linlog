//! The coloured structure graph of a proof structure and the tests the
//! correctness criterion runs on it.
//!
//! The vertices are the occurrences. The edges are the premise edges of
//! every `⊗` and `⅋` and the axiom links. The colouring: the two premise
//! edges of a `⅋` share a colour of their own, and every other edge has a
//! colour of its own, so a cycle is *properly coloured* (no two consecutive
//! edges alike) exactly when it enters and leaves no `⅋` through its two
//! premises, that is, when some switching keeps it. A switching cycle is a
//! properly coloured cycle. Unlinked literals are leaves and lie on no
//! cycle, so the test means the same on a partial structure.
//!
//! By Yeo's theorem, a graph without properly coloured cycle has a vertex
//! that every component of the graph without it meets in edges of one
//! colour only, and deleting such a vertex, which lies on no properly
//! coloured cycle, keeps the property. Repeating the deletion until it
//! stops decides the question exactly: everything goes, or a properly
//! coloured cycle is left. With this colouring the deletion condition needs
//! no colours: a vertex that is not a `⅋` has an edge of its own colour to
//! every neighbour, so it is deletable when every incident edge is a
//! bridge; a `⅋` is deletable when its parent edge is a bridge, or absent,
//! since its premise edges share a colour. Bridges come from one
//! depth-first search per round.
