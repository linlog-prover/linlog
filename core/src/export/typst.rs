//! Typst: formulas in math mode, and derivations as proof trees of the
//! `curryst` package, whose `rule(name: …, premises…, conclusion)` nests
//! the premises inside their conclusion.
//!
//! The connectives are written as their Unicode characters (`⊗ ⅋ ⊕ ⊸ ⊢
//! ⊥ ⊤`), which Typst's math reads with their Unicode math class and which
//! no renaming of Typst's symbol names can break; `&` is escaped and set
//! as a binary operator, `?` set as an ordinary symbol so that no
//! punctuation space follows it, and `1` bold. A fragment is a sequent in
//! `$…$` or a `#prooftree(…)` call, for a document that imports `rule`
//! and `prooftree` from curryst [`CURRYST`]; a standalone document imports
//! them itself and sizes the page to its content. Neither chooses a font:
//! the output is set in the fonts of the document it goes into. curryst cannot align
//! turnstiles, so every sequent is centred. An open goal of a proof in
//! progress is its sequent under vertical dots, with no inference line.
//! curryst nests its layout at every level of the tree, so Typst refuses a
//! tree more than about eleven inferences high ("maximum show rule depth
//! exceeded"); the LaTeX export has no such limit.
//!
//! An atom named by one letter is written as it is, in math italic; any
//! other name is a string in `italic(…)`, with `"` and `\` escaped, since
//! Typst would read a longer name as a variable of its own. Typst is
//! Unicode throughout, so names beyond ASCII need nothing else.
//!
//! # Examples
