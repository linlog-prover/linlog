//! A precedence parser that keeps its own stack and writes the terms it
//! reads straight into the arena, so that neither the nesting of a formula
//! nor its length costs any of the caller's stack.
//!
//! The syntax it reads is documented on [`Sequent`](crate::Sequent), the
//! type a library user meets it on.
//!
//! The arena holds the formulas in negation normal form, one-sided: the
//! formulas left of the turnstile are negated, `A ⊸ B` is `A^⊥ ⅋ B`, and a
//! negation is pushed to the atoms. The parser writes every term as it
//! stands in the text and notes where a negation applies; one pass from
//! the last term to the first then dualises what stands under an odd
//! number of them.
