//! The memo of stable sequents. A proved sequent is a fact about its two
//! zones that holds regardless of how the search reached it; a failed one
//! is a fact only relative to the copy budget that was left when it failed,
//! unless the search space below it was explored without ever hitting the
//! budget. A complete failure holds as well for every sequent that differs
//! in interchangeable members of the linear zone only, so it is kept under
//! a key with every such member replaced by the first of its class (the
//! *canonical* key). A proof names its occurrences and stays under the
//! sequent's own key, and so does a failure cut by the budget: shared, it
//! would answer for a relative that the search of the sequent itself
//! leads to, level after level, and keep both from ever being complete.
//! One table holds all three: a key that is not canonical holds a proof
//! or a cut failure, a canonical one may also hold a complete failure,
//! which is all a relative reads there. The table has a cap in entries
//! and takes its memory from the search's account; when the search runs on
//! several threads it is one shard of a sharded map, [`Shared`](self::Shared), whose
//! merge under the shard's lock keeps the same invariant: an entry's
//! validity only ever grows.
