//! Interchangeable occurrences. Two occurrences of the same formula are
//! distinct members of a sequent, but nothing a proof does tells them
//! apart: every rule looks at an occurrence's connective, its subformulas
//! and, two-sided, its position, and all of these are the same for both.
//! So a sequent stays as provable, by a proof of the same shape, when a
//! member is replaced by another occurrence of the same formula in the
//! same position, and the search need only try one of each kind.
