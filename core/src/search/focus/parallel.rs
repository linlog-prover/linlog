//! The focused engine on several threads: cube-and-conquer over the
//! choices near the root, and-parallel `&` premises, and one memo and one
//! proof arena shared by every worker.
//!
//! A choice among alternatives (the focus on a stable sequent, the side
//! of a `⊕`, the splits of a `⊗`) within the first [`LEVELS`] such
//! choices of a branch runs its alternatives as tasks of the pool: the
//! engine that meets the choice spawns a worker for each alternative but
//! the first, a copy of its own state at that point (the branch stack,
//! the nesting depth, the budget) with pools of its own, which is the
//! per-worker scratch, and runs the first alternative on one more worker
//! on its own thread; the first alternative to succeed raises the
//! choice's flag, which every worker of the choice polls, and the others
//! stop at their next stable sequent. Below those levels every worker runs the sequential
//! engine, so the tasks are few and large. The `&` rule within the same
//! levels runs its two premises the same way, the first to fail
//! cancelling the other. The levels of the copy bound never overlap:
//! `run` deepens on the root engine, which is alone until its first
//! choice, and every task of a level has ended when the level's answer is
//! read.
