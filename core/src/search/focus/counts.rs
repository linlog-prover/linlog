/// What a formula occurrence can contribute to the per-atom balance of a
/// sequent, and to the `MLL` count equation, precomputed for every
/// occurrence of a forest.
///
/// **Intervals.** For an atom `a`, the balance of a sequent is the number of
/// `a` literals minus the number of `~a` literals it decomposes into; every
/// axiom consumes one of each, so a provable sequent has balance zero for
/// every atom. Under `&` and `⊕` only one side of the connective is
/// decomposed, so a formula's contribution is an interval `lo ..= hi`:
/// a literal is `±1`, `⊗` and `⅋` sum their sides, `&` and `⊕` take the
/// hull of theirs, and units contribute nothing. A sequent whose summed
/// interval excludes zero for some atom is unprovable. `⊤` proves any
/// sequent it appears in, so an occurrence with a `⊤` below it *absorbs*:
/// its row is meaningless and any sequent containing it passes. Rows are
/// sparse, over the atoms that occur below the occurrence.
///
/// An atom with a literal below a `?` or `!` anywhere in the problem gets no
/// entry in any row: copies and discards break its balance. A `⊤` below a
/// `?` or `!` makes the check useless altogether, since a copy of it
/// absorbs any imbalance; [`absorbs_from_copies`](Self::absorbs_from_copies)
/// says so.
///
/// **Weight.** In the multiplicative fragment with units, every cut-free
/// proof of a sequent of `c` formulas with `t` tensors, `p` pars, `u` ones
/// and `b` bottoms below them satisfies `c = t − p − u + b + 2`, or `≥` with
/// Mix, because every leaf is an axiom or a `1` and every `⊗` or Mix joins
/// two subproofs. The weight of an occurrence is `t − p − u + b` over its
/// subtree, so the equation is a sum over the members of a sequent. It is
/// unsound as soon as additives or exponentials appear: `⊢ a ⊕ b, ~a` is
/// provable with `b` unbalanced, and a `⊤` closes any sequent.
