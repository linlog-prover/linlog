//! Proof-net search for unit-free MLL, with or without Mix. A cut-free
//! proof of MLL is determined by its axiom linking, so the search
//! enumerates linkings over a [`ProofStructure`] by backtracking and keeps
//! the first one the correctness criterion accepts.
//!
//! Before any link, the count equation `c = t − p + 2` (`c` conclusions,
//! `t` tensor and `p` par occurrences; `≥` with Mix) and the balance of
//! every atom reject most unprovable sequents at once. Then each step
//! chooses the unlinked literal with the fewest admissible partners and
//! tries them in order. A partner is admissible when it is unlinked and
//! dual, when the two literals do not hang under a common `⊗` of one
//! conclusion, when the `⅋`-free skeleton does not join them already, and
//! when the partners of equal literal conclusions stay in the order of the
//! conclusions, which breaks that symmetry. The exact acyclicity test runs
//! after every link on a small structure and after every fourth link on a
//! large one, and on every complete linking, which is then a proof net: the
//! count equation is the connectedness equation of a complete acyclic
//! linking. The net is sequentialized into the proof term returned.
