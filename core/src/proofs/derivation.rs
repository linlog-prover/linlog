//! The derivation view: a proof term unfolded into the tree of explicit
//! sequents and rule names of the standard one-sided sequent calculus, with
//! the term's dyadic bookkeeping expanded into dereliction, contraction and
//! weakening. Renderers and exporters read this view, never the term.
//!
//! The translation keeps the derivation small: the standard sequent of a
//! subproof is `⊢ ?Θ, Γ` for the unrestricted zone `Θ` it needs (see
//! [`check`](crate::proofs::check)), not for the zone in force. So a copy is a
//! dereliction, and a contraction as well when the copied formula is used
//! again above; the `?` step is nothing when its formula is used above and
//! a weakening otherwise; a `⊗` or Mix contracts the `?` formulas both
//! premises use, below the rule; and a `&` weakens, above each premise, the
//! `?` formulas only the other premise uses. A `⊤` absorbs whatever context
//! reaches it, so nothing is weakened above it.
//!
//! An intuitionistic derivation is the same tree over the same term, read
//! two-sided: every sequent has one goal, the inferences carry the
//! intuitionistic rule names (`⊸L` for a `⊗` on a hypothesis, `⊗L` for a
//! `⅋` on one, `!L` for a dereliction, and so on), and what a `⊤` absorbs
//! is distributed so that each premise keeps exactly one goal.
