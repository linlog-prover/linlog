//! The proof checker: it derives, node by node, the sequent a proof term
//! proves under the rules of the dyadic sequent calculus and accepts the
//! term only if the root derives the proof's sequent. It is the reference
//! for what a proof is, so it shares no code with any search engine and must
//! never: an engine's proofs are validated by something that cannot repeat
//! the engine's mistakes.
//!
//! The pass is bottom-up, one node at a time in arena order, and never
//! recurses. What a subproof proves is a `State`, a sequent kept as two
//! tables of its members; the one rule whose conclusion the premises do not
//! determine, `⊤`, is handled by a flag that says the subproof proves its
//! sequent under any further context. A node's sequent is built from its
//! premises' own: the last node to read a premise takes its sequent and
//! changes it in place, an earlier reader a copy, so what the pass holds at
//! any moment is the sequents some later node still reads. Those are
//! counted in bytes as they come and go, and a pass that would hold more
//! than its bound ends with a refusal, which is no verdict on the proof.
//!
//! No arithmetic here may wrap, in any build: a term from a file is
//! hostile input, and a counter that wrapped once made a term a proof
//! that was none. So every integer says at its declaration why it stays
//! in range, or saturates into a refusal.
//!
//! In intuitionistic mode the same pass also checks the one-succedent
//! condition against the sequent's intuitionistic reading: every derived
//! linear zone holds at most one formula in output position, exactly one
//! unless a `⊤` above absorbs the rest, a `⊤` never absorbs a second
//! output, weakening never discards the goal, and Mix has no premise with
//! a goal at all. Every intuitionistic rule is a classical rule on the
//! one-sided sequent, so nothing else is intuitionistic about a proof.
