//! Step-by-step proving: a derivation of the standard sequent calculus
//! built top-down, with open goals as leaves, over the occurrence forest of
//! a sequent. A client names a goal, a formula in it and a rule; the rule
//! is validated against the formula, the mode and, in intuitionistic mode,
//! the one-succedent condition, and the goals it leaves are returned. The
//! search can close any goal, and a finished derivation translates back
//! into a proof term that the checker validates, so this layer is trusted
//! no more than an engine.
//!
//! The inferences are those of the derivation view, with the same sequent
//! representation (occurrence ids in ascending order, with repeats) and
//! the same rule names; an open goal is an inference with [`Rule::Open`]
//! and no premises. The arena is top-down: the root is inference 0 and a
//! step appends the goals it opens at the end, so a premise has a larger
//! index than its conclusion, the reverse of a [`Derivation`], which
//! [`Interactive::derivation`] renumbers.
//!
//! Needs the cargo feature `interactive` (on by default).
