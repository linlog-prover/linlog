//! Proofs: terms over occurrence ids, the checker that validates a term
//! against its sequent independently of any engine, and the derivation view
//! for humans and exporters.
//!
//! A [`Proof`] is an arena of [`Node`]s, one per rule instance, over the
//! [`Forest`] of the sequent it proves. A node names the rule, the
//! occurrence the rule acts on and the nodes that prove its premises. The
//! rules are those of the dyadic sequent calculus every engine searches in:
//! the standard rules, with the `?` formulas handled through an unrestricted
//! zone `Θ` (a `?` step moves a formula into it, a copy uses it without
//! consuming it), plus weakening for affine mode and Mix. A node does not
//! record the sequent it proves: the checker derives that from the premises,
//! and the derivation view shows it.
