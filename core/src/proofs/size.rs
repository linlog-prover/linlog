//! The size of a derivation, computed from the proof term without building
//! the derivation: one pass of the checker, with a handful of numbers kept
//! per node. A term stores a subproof that several nodes share once and
//! the derivation unfolds it at every use, so a derivation can be
//! exponentially larger than its term; the numbers here are what says so
//! before anything is built.
//!
//! All of them are `u64` and saturate: every sum and product here is a
//! saturating one, and every difference too, so nothing wraps in any
//! build. A number that reached `u64::MAX` stays there through every
//! later sum, since nothing is ever taken away from a count of
//! inferences, of characters or of a height on its way to the root; so a
//! saturated count shows in the size returned, whose estimate in bytes is
//! then over every bound.
