# Step 31: a Rocq library of linlog's own

You are working in the linlog repository. CLAUDE.md applies throughout: jj
only (never git), thematic commits as soon as a unit is done, doc comments on
every item, the verification table, no pushing. The step takes three
to four sessions, each leaving something usable; this prompt is finished
at the review of step 30 (the checker's part was added at the review of
step 18). Read before you start:

- `plan/later.md`: "Second certificate kernels: a Rocq library of
  linlog's own, NanoYalla kept for compatibility" (the shape is the
  author's and is the requirement), "Follow-ups: intuitionistic mode".
- `plan/reports/12-certificates.md`, `17-assessment.md` (3.10 with its
  three corrections, the author's answers 4 and 6), `18-bounded-proofs.md`.
- `plan/README.md`: D6, D15, D17, D20; `plan/notes/distribution.md`.
- `core/src/proofs/check.rs` as step 18 left it: the Rocq checker
  verifies this algorithm, once.

## Goal

Every mode has a statement and a certificate: classical, with Mix,
affine, and two-sided intuitionistic, as a lemma over plain inductives
that a reader checks against a textbook, proved by computation from the
proof term. The NanoYalla export stays exactly as it is.

## What is fixed now

1. **Name and place** (the author, 2026-10-03): the library is `linlog`,
   under `rocq/` in this repository, logical path `Linlog`, and the
   flake builds it the way nixpkgs builds a Rocq library, as a package
   and as a check that compiles every certificate of both kernels and
   prints the assumptions of the main theorem (none).
2. **The standard library only**, by the conventions of the day read
   from the reference manual (`From Stdlib`, a `_RocqProject`, an opam
   file named for the archive's convention, `rocq-linlog`, with the
   addresses of `github.com/linlog-prover/linlog`), on the Rocq nixpkgs
   ships.
3. **Certificates as data**: the proof term as a Rocq datatype, a checker
   as a function, one soundness theorem per calculus.
4. **Stages**: the definitions and the checker with its soundness for
   classical LL; Mix, affine and the two-sided statement; the bridges to
   NanoYalla's `ll` and to Yalla's standalone `nanoill.v`, and for Mix
   the reduction to `?(⊥⊗⊥), Γ`, which Yalla proves without cut
   (`mix2_to_ll` in `ll_fragments.v`) and can be followed.
5. **Quantifiers are coming** (D17): the formula type and the checker
   are written so that a first-order extension is a second development
   beside this one, and the report says how.
6. **In the exporter** a second kernel behind `rocq::Options`, chosen by
   the mode where the user did not choose.

7. **The algorithm to verify** is `core/src/proofs/check.rs` as steps
   18 and 20 leave it, whose rules `.claude/rules/core-proofs.md` states
   under "The checker": per node a state `⊢ Θ ; Γ` with the absorbing flag,
   `Θ` the least unrestricted zone, the rule table of `Pass::rule`, the
   one-succedent condition as three clauses, and the conclusion at the
   root. The Rust pass is one of several ways to run that algorithm
   (states moved between nodes, tables for the zones); the Rocq function
   is another and need not mirror its memory discipline. The refusal of
   a zone too large to conclude (`Problem::Surplus`) exists because
   Rust's counters are finite; over `nat` it is a lemma or nothing, and
   the report says which. `Problem::Memory` is a refusal for lack of
   memory, no verdict, and no part of the algorithm. The first implementation
   (`core/src/proofs/oracle.rs`, lists and no tables) is the closer text
   to translate.

## What comes later

The proof term's API was settled by step 28, before the release. Cut
(step 34) adds one rule to the proof term: the datatype, the checker
and the soundness proof are written so that a rule is a case added and
nothing is redone. No `Admitted`, no axiom.

## Deliverables

Thematic jj commits per stage; `plan/reports/31-rocq-library.md`.
